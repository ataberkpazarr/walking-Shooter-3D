# walking-Shooter-3D

This project can not be classified as finished game but it is a trial for myself. I used some new mechanics and features that I have not experienced before.

I used New Unity Input System and a brand new Third Person Character Controller Package. 
In this project a character walks through the area which it exists by W-A-S-D controllers, runs when pressed shift and jumps with space, aims with right click and
shoots with left click.
